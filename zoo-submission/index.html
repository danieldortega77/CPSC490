<h1> Making Music with Pathfinding Algorithms </h1>

<h3> Abstract </h3>


<p>Pathfinding, at its core, is finding a path between two points. More narrowly, it is finding the shortest route between two nodes of a graph. This is applicable in the context of mathematical graphs: whether they are weighted, directed, or otherwise. In computer science, many different pathfinding algorithms have been devised with varying runtimes and optimality.</p>
<p>When first learning how pathfinding algorithms work, many students can be confused how different algorithms search the sample space. This naturally has led to the creation of pathfinding visualization programs. While these visualizations often help people better understand the general concept of how each algorithm searches for a path, adding some other kind of representation might be able to further enhance that understanding.</p>
<p>As a result, I created a musical visualization of various pathfinding algorithms as they progress from start to finish. Within a given grid made up of cells, each cell contains a musical note which will be played when an algorithm "visits" that cell. This produces unique musical output for various pathfinding algorithms, distinguishing between them and possibly allowing students to better understand how each algorithm works.</p>
<p>The programâ€™s inputs include the following: which pathfinding algorithm is used, where walls are placed, the start node, the end node, and the pitch value of each node. With experimentation, I created grid configurations which, when played by a pathfinding algorithm, sound like music. Organizing pitches within the grid to create chords and higher-order structure resulted in pattern-like arpeggios which vary depending on the algorithm chosen.</p>
