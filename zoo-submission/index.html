<h1> Making Music with Pathfinding Algorithms </h1>
<h3> Author: Daniel Ortega </h3>

<h3> Abstract </h3>

<p>When first learning how pathfinding algorithms work, many students can be confused how different algorithms search the sample space. This naturally has led to the creation of pathfinding visualization programs. While these visualizations often help people better understand the general concept of how each algorithm searches for a path, adding some other kind of representation might be able to further enhance that understanding.</p>

<p>As a result, I created a musical visualization of various pathfinding algorithms as they progress from start to finish. Within a given grid made up of cells, each cell contains a musical note which will be played when an algorithm "visits" that cell. This produces unique musical output for various pathfinding algorithms, distinguishing between them.</p>
